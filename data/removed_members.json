Contradictory as it seems, all 3 shared one common denominator. There were problems that needed to be solved in all. I use my knowledge and my ability to obtain knowledge to my advantage in becoming an avid problem solver. My philosophy is, and will always lie with understanding the fundamentals. Building a proper base for myself based on fundamentals allows me to dismantle complex problems and produce solutions that drift from convention (or what should have been the convention). With this philosophy I have done well both in the industry and academic realm graduating with First class honours in Mechanical Engineering. I am armed with knowledge and will work relentlessly to positively impact every industry I set hands on.",

During the program, her thesis involved the transmission of a detonation wave through a non-uniform medium. She was also involved in a collaborative study on the interaction of a shock wave with an array of flames for detonation propulsion applications. In August 2017, Kelsey presented these research projects at the International Colloquium on the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems. Her experience involves programming in fortran, matlab and c++ mainly. She has continued interest in numerical modelling of physical systems. Ultimately, her goal is to continue learning and honing her programming skills.",
