Contradictory as it seems, all 3 shared one common denominator. There were problems that needed to be solved in all. I use my knowledge and my ability to obtain knowledge to my advantage in becoming an avid problem solver. My philosophy is, and will always lie with understanding the fundamentals. Building a proper base for myself based on fundamentals allows me to dismantle complex problems and produce solutions that drift from convention (or what should have been the convention). With this philosophy I have done well both in the industry and academic realm graduating with First class honours in Mechanical Engineering. I am armed with knowledge and will work relentlessly to positively impact every industry I set hands on.",
