		"members": "Shanta Sukhoo",
		"abstract": "Optimization of a problem is a mathematical technique for selecting the best outcome (subject to a set of contraints) from a set of available alternatives. Taxis and maxis have opperated the same way for many years in Trinidad and Tobago. There is, therefore, an opportunity to change the way in which the drivers opperate in an effort to maximise their income on a daily basis. This can be accomplished via a recommender system which can direct the drivers to the route(s) that is the most profitable. The use of this system can also potentially aid the passenger since the lenght of time they may have to wait on taxis would be greatly reduced."

	"Association Rule Mining of Household Electrical Energy Usage": {
		"members": "Devika Bhagwandin",
		"abstract": "In a smart grid network, household energy consumption is monitored by the use of residential smart meters. These meters however do not provide data of individual appliance consumption. In this paper, disaggregated electrical energy is analyzed using the apriori algorithm in association rule mining. It is expected that such analysis will assist in electrical energy conservation as the consumer will be aware of how much energy is consumed by individual appliances."
