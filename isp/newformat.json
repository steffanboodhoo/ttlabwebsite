To report ISP performance, the subject remains as \"ISP Performance\", but the format for the email body has changed to the following: \nLine #1: ISP Name (Digicel, Greendot, Flow, Blink, or Massy. \nLine #2: Achived rate (in Mbps) using a Miami server as the target on speedtest.net\nLine #3: The price paid monthly for your connection\nWe thank you all for your continued support of this endeavour.\n-- TTLAB"
